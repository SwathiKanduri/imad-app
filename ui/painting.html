        Pablo Picasso rightly said that every child is a born artist, the problem is to retain that artist within themselves. This universe is full of art and inspiration, that is what everyone can see, but it takes a really talented and visionary artist to pick paint and brush and illustrate their thoughts, visions and this beautiful universe into paintings.
